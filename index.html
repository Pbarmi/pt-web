      <b>My Beauty My Standards</b>
      <P>
      
      </P>
Hi everyone, in today’s topic I am discussing a somewhat controversial topic around Asian Women’s beauty standards. Now, this probably is an alien topic to those who don’t know what I am talking about and to others it is that topic that is never ending that constantly is what we hear hours about.
<P>

</P>
I am a 20-year-old, British Sikh woman living in the UK. I have tattoos, I have short hair, I have piercings I am not skinny, I am not tall. How does that make you feel? I literally could be an Auntyji’s nightmare really. I hear comments all the time saying; “Oh wow, she has tattoos and she isn’t even married yet”, “Her piercings don't look nice at all", “Her skin isn’t fair enough she needs to lighten it” and finally, the classic question, “What would your future mother-in-law and your in laws think? You name it, I have heard it. 
<P>

</P>
It is 2019, soon to be 2020. 100 years ago beauty standards were completely different. It was the starting point of the famous roaring 20's. 100 years later, social media is the front face of, what you need to do to be beautful within today's society. You need to have long hair, your makeup needs to be very refined, you have to be the right body shape etc. 
<p>

</p>
But, on the lighter note of this issue there are several influencers/public speakers out on social media who, are making big changes and breaking down 2019's beauty standards. One of the being, Lilly Singh whp is, a Sikh Canadian Youtuber who, lives in LA. She is an activist for her campaign called, 'Girl love' and recently came out as Bisexual which, was so important as she is a Punjabi Canadian Woman giving a voice for LGBTQ+ communties across the world, especially for creating awareness and understanding of LGBTQ+ for the South Asian community. 
<p>

</p>
Another amazing woman who, is breaking taboos and stigmas within the British Asian community as well as, the world is Harnaam Kaur. She is a Motivational speaker, Social activist, and apart of the #mybodymyrules movement. She is a woman who, has a beard, tattoos, piercings and an amazing strong willed person. Her journey, is inspiring and her movement is encouraging young British Punjabi women and men to love themselves and be proud of who they are, which, is such an important message to send out the young people today. 
<p>

</p>
It is time now to stand up and break taboos and stigmas which, generations have created for us to so called "look up to". You are Beautiful, Empowering and Unique. 
Thank you for reading. Feel free to message me through my socials.
